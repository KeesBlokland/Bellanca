# Bellanca
These files are basically what Kai created, just cleaned them up for FreeCAD. (version 0.20.0 on Ubuntu-latest)
I imported the Step files, but for reasons unclear, there appear to be multiple copies of everything. So, just removed all the extra stuff, so that I have a normal working set. 

Since I rebuild my router (hardware is a StepFour) to get rid of all the windows stuff, and I would like to start using FreeCad in ernest, this project will do just fine to teach me ;-)

From what I can see and deduct, this project has a very long history, sadly not everything is known to everybody. But one thing is sure, the amoutn of hours that went into this, is staggering! Something you don't appreciate until you do it yourself.

Thanks for all your hard work Kai!
